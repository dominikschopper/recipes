These glazed peach scones taste like a peach pie with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and they are anything but dry.

## Ingredients
- 2 cups + 2 Tbsp all purpose flour
- 1/3 cup brown sugar
- 1 Tbsp baking powder
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 1/2 cup unsalted butter, cubed and cold
- 1 egg
- 1/4 cup heavy whipping cream, plus more for brushing
- 1/4 cup sour cream
- 2 tsp vanilla extract
- 1/2 cup fresh peaches, diced

### Vanilla Glaze

- 1/2 cup powdered sugar
- 1 Tbsp vanilla extract
- 1-3 Tbsp heavy whipping cream

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
2. In a bowl, mix together flour, brown sugar, baking powder, and salt. Once combined, cut in the butter with a fork or pastry cutter until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.
3. Whisk together heavy cream, sour cream, egg, and vanilla extract. Slowly add the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients, and mix until just combined.
4. Stir in the peaches, and mix until just combined.
5. On a well-floured surface, turn out the scone dough and pat into a small disk that's about a Â½" thick. Cut into 6-8 slices, and transfer to the baking sheet. Brush each scone with just a bit of heavy cream.
6. Bake for 16-18 minutes, or just until golden brown. Allow to cool.

### Glaze

Whisk together powdered sugar, vanilla extract, and 1 Tbsp of heavy cream. If the glaze is too thick, continue adding in heavy cream, one 1 Tbsp at a time, until it has reached the desired consistency. Pour over warm scones and enjoy!
